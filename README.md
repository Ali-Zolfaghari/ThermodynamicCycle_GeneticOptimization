# ThermodynamicCycle_GeneticOptimization
The genetic algorithm is a method for solving both constrained and unconstrained optimization  problems that are based on natural selection, the process that drives biological evolution. The genetic algorithm repeatedly modifies a population of individual solutions. At each step, the  genetic algorithm selects individuals at random from the current population to be parents and uses them to produce the children for the next generation. Over successive generations, the  population "evolves" toward an optimal solution. You can apply the genetic algorithm to solve a  variety of optimization problems that are not well suited for standard optimization algorithms,  including problems in which the objective function is discontinuous, nondifferentiable, stochastic, or highly nonlinear.
